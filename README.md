### Short description of available functionalities

The project consists of the game Stranded Away, which is made in Unity (DESKTOP game), a user interface on the web and a backend with a corresponding MongoDB database. The user group includes all players who would like to play MacroQuiet games.
First, players should register and verify their information through a website. The application will consist of: "news"/home page where news, game releases and changelogs will be displayed..., log in/register page, user profile, public scoreboard, area with graphs i.e. personalized player "stats", page with won trophies/achievements and download pages. The web interface will also have an admin version where the admin will be able to add new posts to the news page and publish a new game release. After the user downloads and installs the game, he will have to log in to play it. The game, in addition to a short story mode, will contain 1 game mode "Floor is Lava!" where the player gets points/rank the longer he survives. This data will be stored in the database and will be displayed publicly on the web interface (scoreboard). Progress to unlock achievements will also be monitored and stored, which will also be displayed and synced on the web.
